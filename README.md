To Install just download the zipball from the master branch and upload via the Joomla back-panel. 

NB. This is a developer preview and it is expected that people can either find their way creating packages from the files provided at this point or install from directory. Anyway follow the instructions above!

At this early stage documentation is still very scanty. However i am pretty open to any suggestions and request via email. On our forums at http://tuiyo.co.uk. Additional installation instructions can be found at http://docs.tuiyo.co.uk/installation
